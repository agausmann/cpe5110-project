# Comp Eng 5110 - Booth3/Booth4 Simulator

This is the simulation library and command-line utilties, developed for the
class project and accompanying the technical paper. It is written in Rust and
can be run on the campus Linux machines.

## Dependencies

Make sure Rust and Cargo are installed. The version on the campus Linux
machines should be sufficient, but if you want to run this on your local
machine, follow the [Getting started
guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) for Rust.

## Usage

To run the simulator on the command line, open a terminal in this folder and
type the following command:

```
cargo run
```

After that, follow the prompts to input the parameters and perform a
simulation.
